      // To send messages through a one-way QR code:
      // - the process is inherently driven by a human, we assume that they will show the
      //   screen to the scanner (within the scan area) until the transfer is successful
      //   and the receiving sice can move the process further. When this happens the user
      //   will stop presenting the screen, we therefore don't need to have any ACKs etc.
      //
      // - the more data we add to a single QR code the higher the data density of the
      //   code becomes, as density grows the read error rate increases. We therefore need
      //   to start at a reasonable density and slowly decrease the density as time progress.
      //
      // - the rate of QR code changes also increase the risk of a scan failure, we therefore
      //   need to start at a reasonable rate and decrease. The scanning rate seem to be affected
      //   by the scanning platform and available APIs.
      //
      // - the data sent belongs to a single meeting instance, to minimize the risk of human
      //   error we therefore verify that the data transfered belongs to the right meeting.
      //   This is achieved with an HMAC using the meeting code as key.
      //
      // - a single frame of data is 256b
      //
      // - we first reduce send rate and then reduce data density
      //

      // implemnetation plan
      // - build in browser tested version, it needs to work in a test setup before
      //   we try to transfer between two devices.

      // sending:
      // - turn all data into packets and then add a final packet with a transfer checksum
      //
      // receiving:
      // - recieve packet by packet until all received, check that the checksum matches
      //   the received data
      //
      // packets are received in increasing order until the checksum is received
      // all frames are sent multiple times to enable a receiver to start receiving
      // at any point or to drop a single packet for a frame and still be able to receover
      // 
      // if we don't add a header to each packet then we will not be able to detect when
      // multiple packaets with the same data is sent. oops!
      // 
      // QR codes need a 10:1 distance to size ratio
      //
      // a frame is made up by individual packets, a packet is a single qr code that
      // is shown for n milliseconds. We start with higher data density and move towards
      // lower density, we then start over at the initial data density but showing each
      // frame a little longer.
      //
      // for this test we only use text so each packet is prefixed with the packet
      // number using ':' as a separator. For an actual implementation we could use binary
      // data instead of text.
      //
      // practical tests indicate that the scanner works at a high rate even at longer
      // distances. So successful scans will contain many many duplicates.
      //
      // The goal is to create a demo that transfers time from one device to another.
      // The receiving sice can then show the difference in time between it's system
      // time and the time just received. This is not strictly true :) but it allow
      // us to somewhat demonstrate what latency we can expect for small data sets.
